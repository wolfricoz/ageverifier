<h1 style="text-align: center">Privacy Policy</h1>

## Introduction

This privacy policy outlines how AgeVerifier (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you interact with our bot. By using AgeVerifier, you agree to the terms of this policy.

In this document, I may refer to **servers** as **guilds**, as that is the terminology used within Discord's API.


## Why do we store your data?

To verify users, we collect the (non-sensitive) personal data:

* date of birth: Used to calculate the age and to verify future verification attempts.
* age: The age is not stored, however it is submitted by the user to check if it matches the date of birth

The combination of age and date of birth is used as a simple method of verifying the age of users, by storing the date
of birth we can ensure that users give the same date of birth in the future interactions, or flag them for a
discrepancy.

### Legal Basis for Data Collection
We collect and process your data under the lawful basis of legitimate interest (ensuring compliance with platform rules) and **user consent** when you interact with AgeVerifier.

### Discrepancies

In the event of an age discrepancy, we reserve the right to request additional information to confirm your legal age. This process may involve:

- **Minor Discrepancies**: If the discrepancy appears to be a simple error (e.g., a typo), we may ask you to provide clarification.
- **Significant Discrepancies**: In cases where the discrepancy is more substantial, we may request that you provide legal documentation (e.g., government-issued ID). Only the necessary information—your date of birth and a note with your username—will be required. All other sensitive details in the document, such as your name or address, should be blacked out for privacy.

**Important**:
- We will **not store** the legal documentation you provide. Only your date of birth and a boolean flag indicating that your age has been verified via ID will be retained.
- This process ensures that your privacy is respected while maintaining the integrity of our age verification system.


### Age Restrictions

AgeVerifier is designed for use by individuals aged 18 and above. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use our services. In such cases, your data will not be stored, and only a boolean flag indicating that you are underage will be retained.



## How We Use Your Data

We use the data collected for the following purposes:

* Verifying user eligibility based on age.
* Ensuring compliance with platform or legal age requirements.
* Improving the functionality of our age verification system.

### Data Minimization
We only collect the minimum amount of data required for age verification and do not use your data for purposes other than those explicitly stated in this policy.


## Automated Decision-Making

AgeVerifier uses automated processes to flag discrepancies in submitted data (e.g., mismatched dates of birth). Flagged cases may require manual review by guild staff. Additionally, guilds can enable automated approvals for correct age and date of birth matches to reduce the strain on the guild's staff.


## How We Store and Protect Your Data

Once your age has been verified by guild staff, we take the following measures to store and protect your data:

* Encryption: Your data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
* Database Storage: Your data is securely stored in our database.
* Retention Policy: Your data is removed after one year of inactivity on guilds using AgeVerifier.

### Whitelisted Guilds and Data Access

Certain whitelisted guilds are granted access to specific data to assist in managing the database. These guilds are
carefully vetted and must adhere to the following guidelines:

* Access to Dates of Birth:
*
    * Whitelisted guilds may only view dates of birth to verify users' ages.

* Editing Dates of Birth:
*
    * Guilds may only edit dates of birth in specific cases, such as correcting typos or resolving discrepancies in age
      verification.

* Restricted Access to Management:
*
    * Dates of birth are accessible only to the management team of the guild.

### Accountability for Whitelisted Guilds

Whitelisted guilds are trained and regularly inspected by AgeVerifier to ensure compliance. If a guild fails to adhere
to these guidelines, it will lose its whitelisted status.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties unless required by law or to comply with legal obligations. Your
personal data is strictly used for verification purposes within the AgeVerifier bot.
### Use of Data by roleplaymeets

As AgeVerifier is owned by roleplaymeets, we may also use your data for purposes directly related to our website,
such as verifying age for participation in its features or services. This usage will:

* Be limited to the same verification purposes outlined above.
* Adhere to the same data protection measures, including encryption and limited access.

We will never sell, lease, or otherwise distribute your personal data to unauthorized third parties.

## User rights

* Access to Your Data:
* * You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.

* Correction of Inaccurate Data:

* Data Deletion:
