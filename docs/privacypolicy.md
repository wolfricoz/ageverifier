<h1 style="text-align: center">Privacy Policy</h1>

_Last Updated: 14/02/2025_

# Introduction
This privacy policy outlines how AgeVerifier ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your (the end user) personal data when you interact with the AgeVerifier bot. By using AgeVerifier, you agree to the terms and conditions of this policy.

References in this document may refer to servers as guilds, as that is the terminology used within Discord's API.

## Why do we store your data?
To verify users, we collect the (non-sensitive) personal data:

- **Date of birth:** Used to calculate the age and to verify future verification attempts.
- **Age:** This data is collected but not stored; it is collected from the user only to validate that the age matches the date of birth submitted.
- **Discord ID:** While not technically personal data, we collect and store users’ Discord ID and combine it with the submitted Date of Birth.

The combination of age and date of birth is used as a simple method of verifying the age of users. By storing the date of birth with Discord ID, we can ensure that users give the same date of birth in future interactions or flag them for a discrepancy.

## Legal Basis for Data Collection
We collect, store, and process user data under the lawful basis of **legitimate interest** (ensuring compliance with platform rules) and **user consent** when users interact with AgeVerifier.

## Discrepancies
In the event of an age discrepancy, we reserve the right to request additional information to confirm the user’s legal age. This process may involve:

- **Minor Discrepancies:** If the discrepancy appears to be a simple error (e.g., a typo), we may ask for clarification.
- **Significant Discrepancies:** In cases where the discrepancy is more substantial, moderation staff from an AgeVerifier member guild may request that legal documentation (e.g., government-issued ID) be provided to validate the user-submitted information.

In such cases, staff from that server will advise on what is required to resolve the discrepancy. Requirements may vary between member guilds depending on their individual rules and requirements, and they reserve the right to deny access to users who do not comply with these requirements. All other sensitive details in the verification artifact, such as name, address, and unrequested biometrics, should be masked out by the submitter for privacy.

For clarity, **AgeVerifier will not store the legal documentation provided**. Only your date of birth and a conditional flag indicating that the user’s age has been verified via ID will be retained. This process ensures that user privacy is respected while maintaining the integrity of our age verification system.

## Age Restrictions
AgeVerifier is designed for use by individuals aged 18 and above. Anyone under the age of 18 may not use our services. In cases where an individual under 18 submits their information, only the Discord ID and a conditional flag indicating that the user is underage will be retained in our system.

## How We Use Your Data
We use the user-submitted data collected for the following purposes:

- Verifying user eligibility based on date of birth.
- Ensuring compliance with platform, guild, or legal age requirements.
- Improving the accuracy and/or functionality of our age verification system.

## Data Minimization
We only collect the minimum amount of data required for age verification and do not use user data for purposes other than those explicitly stated in this policy.

## Automated Decision-Making
AgeVerifier uses automated processes to flag discrepancies in submitted data (e.g., mismatched dates of birth). Flagged cases may require manual review by guild staff. Additionally, guilds can enable automated approvals for correct age and date of birth matches to reduce the strain on the guild's staff.

## How We Store and Protect Your Data
User data is communicated to the AgeVerifier bot via Discord utilizing **End to End Encryption (EE2E)** and is stored in a database local to the AgeVerifier bot.

## Retention Policy
User data is pruned from the database automatically after **one year of absence** on member guilds using AgeVerifier.

## Whitelisted Guilds and Data Access
Moderation teams from certain whitelisted guilds are granted access to specific data to assist in managing the AgeVerifier database. These guilds are carefully vetted and must adhere to the following guidelines:

### Access to Dates of Birth
- Whitelisted guilds may only view dates of birth to verify users' ages.

### Editing Dates of Birth
- Whitelisted guilds may only edit dates of birth in specific cases, such as correcting typos or resolving discrepancies in age verification.

### Restricted Access to Management
- Dates of birth are accessible only to the management team of the whitelisted guild.

### Accountability for Whitelisted Guilds
Management teams of whitelisted guilds are trained and regularly inspected by AgeVerifier to ensure compliance. If a guild fails to adhere to these guidelines, it will lose its whitelisted status.

## Rules Pertaining to Member Guilds
Non-whitelisted guilds do not have the ability to access stored dates of birth provided from other member servers and may not directly edit date of birth in any cases.

## Data Sharing
We do not share user personal data with third parties unless required by law or to comply with legal obligations. User personal data is strictly used for verification purposes within the AgeVerifier bot.

We will never sell, lease, or otherwise distribute user personal data to unauthorized third parties.

## User Rights
In accordance with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, users have the following rights regarding personal data:

### Access to User Data
- Users have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about them.

### Correction of Inaccurate Data
- If a user believes that any of the data we hold is incorrect or incomplete, the user can request corrections to ensure accuracy.

### Data Deletion
- Users have the right to request the deletion of that user’s personal data where applicable.

## Processing of Requests
All requests will be responded to within **30 days** after submission in accordance with our retention policy and applicable legal obligations.

### How to Make These Requests?
To make a request, you can:

- Join our support guild.
- Send an email to **rico@roleplaymeets.com**.
- Use the commands provided in a participating server running AgeVerifier:
  - `/gdpr removal`: Can be utilized to request the removal of that user’s data.
  - `/gdpr data`: Can be utilized to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about the user.

For corrections of inaccurate data, please join our support guild and open a ticket for assistance.

**Note:** Excessive or unreasonable requests may incur a fee or be ignored, in accordance with GDPR regulations.

## Data Breach Policy
In the event of a data breach, we will:

- Notify affected users within **72 hours**.
- Take immediate steps to secure data and prevent further breaches.
- Notify the relevant authorities.

## Updates to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through our support guild or other appropriate channels. Continued use of AgeVerifier after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
