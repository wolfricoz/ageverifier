<h1 style="text-align: center">AgeVerifier – Age Verification for Discord Servers</h1>

Prefix: ?<br>
Build: 2.7<br>
Devs: ricostryker



AgeVerifier is a Discord bot designed to help server owners verify the age of their members. Originally developed by Roleplay Meets Reborn for our own community, it has since been made public for other servers. To ensure security and compliance, each verified server requesting access to AgeVerifier is reviewed by our developers to confirm it is a safe environment and does not violate any laws.  

## **Data Collection & GDPR Compliance**  
By submitting your birth date (MM/DD/YYYY) and age, you consent to AgeVerifier storing this information for the sole purpose of verifying your stated age. This data may be shared with relevant parties strictly for verification purposes.  

To request data removal, simply run the `/gdpr removal` command.  

## **How Does AgeVerifier Work?**  
- Checks a user’s age and, if under 18, marks them as a minor without storing sensitive information.  
- Determines whether a user meets the age requirement for your server.  
- Verifies if the user has previously been approved and ensures date of birth consistency.  
- If all checks pass, it automatically assigns roles and welcomes the user.  

## **Additional Features**  
- **Automated Lobby** – Automatically approves users and flags any concerns.  
- **Auto-Kick for Underage Users** – Instantly removes users who do not meet your server’s age threshold.
