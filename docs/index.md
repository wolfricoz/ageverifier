### about

Ageverifier is a discord bot that is meant to be used as a tool for server owners to verify the age of their members.
Created by Roleplay Meets Reborn to verify the age of our members, it has since been made semi-public for other servers
to use.

The bot is main purpose is to verify the age of members and will focus on that. It checks the Roleplay Meets Reborn
database
to see if the user has been verified before, and checks the previously given date of birth to see if the user is being
honest about their age and date of birth.
