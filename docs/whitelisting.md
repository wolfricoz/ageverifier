<h1 style="text-align: center">Whitelisting Procedure</h1>

# Requirements

* Your server must at least have 1000 members
* Your server must be 6 months old.
* You must have a staff team consisting of at least two administrators.
* A valid reason to need access the database and view non-sensitive personal identifiable information (Date of Births)
* Signing an agreement form

If your server does not fulfill these requirements, we reserve the right to charge a one-time 5 dollar service fee.

# Step One: Id Verification

The very first step of being whitelisted is being ID verified by the developer (ricostryker) of Ageverifier, why? This
is to give you a feel how to handle ID verification and because if you ask someone else to ID verify; you must be
willing to do so yourself. Being asked to ID verify is a big request that comes with a lot of legal strings attached and
by doing it **correctly** you can do so safely.

### Safe ID Verification

By [EU GDPR Law](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/right-of-access/what-should-we-consider-when-responding-to-a-request/#ID)
you may request enough information to judge if the information about the user is valid. This means that you may only ask
for **RELEVANT** information such as the date of birth on their ID in our case; each server may change this request a
little to suit their needs.

you may NEVER store an ID without proper procedure, and AgeVerifier does not support any storage of IDs; if an ID is
improperly stored, a user may report your server to the AgeVerifier Staff team.

Here is an example taken from Roleplay Meets: Reborn

```
**__ID Verification__**
Hi, to verify your age we'd like to request you to ID.

**Why do I have to ID?**
There has been a discrepancy with your date of birth and/or age which we feel requires additional verification, this is to verify that you are above the age of 18.

If you feel uncomfortable you may decline to do so; however we reserve the right to decline you access to our server.

**Instructions**
- **Black out everything except your date of birth**
- Include a note with rmr[current year here] and your username written on it. 
- **__After verification please remove your ID.__**

**__We do not retain or store your ID, only your date of birth. Your ID is strictly used for verification purposes only__**

Here is my ID as an example: {image}
```

When asking a user you should give them the reason, an easily to follow list of instructions, a mention that they may
decline to verify - because the user may decline to do so (and you then may deny them access)

# Review your rights and Ageverifiers rights while whitelisted

While being whitelisted by Ageverifier, we give you the express rights to:

* View date of births for verification reasons.
* View/Update/Add/Delete data from the AgeVerifier database to ensure that the data collected is correct.
* Validate Date of Births for other servers (i.e they may request you if this date of birth is correct)

# Staff Data Access Policy

## General Principles

- **Need-to-Know Basis**: Only access data when necessary for moderation or administrative purposes. Do not browse or
  retrieve data without a valid reason.
- **Confidentiality**: Do not share any data with unauthorized individuals. Discussions involving data should be kept
  within appropriate staff channels.
- **Restricted Access**: Higher-level staff (e.g., admins, senior moderators) may have access to more detailed data,
  while lower-level staff (e.g., trial moderators) should have access only to what is necessary for their role.
- **No External Sharing**: Information should not be shared outside of the server except with authorised age-verifier
  staff for the purposes of seeking support for correction of mis-information. If another server makes a request to
  confirm the age of a shared user you are only permitted to confirm a users age and not their date of birth.

## Data Handling Guidelines

- **Timely Data Removal**: If the data is no longer relevant it should be removed or archived according to guidelines.
- **Audit & Logging**: Access to sensitive logs, such as age-verification logs, may be logged to ensure accountability.
  Misuse of access privileges should be investigated.
- **Respect for Privacy**: Even if the data is non-sensitive, treat it with care. Avoid unnecessary commentary or
  discussion about user data, especially in public or casual staff conversations.
- **No Retention of Personal Copies**: Do not download, screenshot, or otherwise retain user data beyond the systems
  where it is stored. If notes are needed, they should be kept within the system's official logging structure.

## Compliance & Training

- **Training & Acknowledgment**: Before gaining access to sensitive logs, staff members should acknowledge their
  responsibilities and agree to uphold privacy standards.
- **Policy Violations**: Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in access revocation, disciplinary action,
  or removal from the whitelist.
- **Access Policy**: You must have a dedicated channel with the access policy posted in your server for staff to easily
  review. You can copy-and-paste these guidelines.

# Failure to follow procedures

To ensure that servers using AgeVerifier follow our guidelines, the AgeVerifier team reserves the right to inspect a
whitelisted server. This may be done randomly once every 6 months or if we receive reports with violations of these
terms of services.

When inspecting a server, we request that you give the AgeVerifier staff member access to all the channels in the server
to verify that no data is stored improperly; we do not require any additional permissions than viewing the channels. The
staff member may request screenshots to confirm channel access permissions which should be provided in a timely manner.

If you break our guidelines, we may take the following actions based on the severity of the violation:

- **A warning**: We understand that mistakes happen and we encourage you to improve!
- **De-whitelisting**: After multiple violations, or if the violation is serious enough we may remove your server from
  being whitelisted.
- **Blacklisting**: For those who willingly attempt to harm the AgeVerifier system, we reserve the right to deny
  servers (and server owners) access to our services.
- **Fees**: If your server is the cause of a data leak, we may request that you pay (partially) for any incurred legal fees.
